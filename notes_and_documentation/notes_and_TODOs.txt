Notes on agent:
- implement and test reduced depth for 
    a) performance: how fast can we get
    b) results: how good is agent

- check other "best-child-selections"
- check agent vs. agent mode: 
    - agent 1 seems to win suspiciously often, for both starting and not starting
    - only tested for few runs as it takes quite long
    - no obvious errors
    - one potential error: player 2 makes best move from perspective of player 1 (which in most
      cases will not be a terrible move but what will also not win games)
    - so far I checked the code and can see no indication of such error; check again later

TODOs:
- add test functions for final/current code 
- clean up code (variable & function names, logic checks, general "cleanliness", clean up imports)
- documentation:
    - funciton documentations as required (see slides)
    - general comments: remove/check for unnecessary comments, add comments where useful
- write README file (first draft at least)
- update gitignore file to ignore unnecessary files
- add requirements fie?
