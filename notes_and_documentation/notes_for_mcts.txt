(Notes for myself, not relevant to assignment/submission)

How it works:

# keep in mind:
# - root is the current game state corresponding to the opponent's last move
# - first level children coorespond the agent's moves
# - second level children correspond to possible opponents moves (and count opponent's wins)
# - and so on for ensuing levels
# - selection using uct score: exploitation vs. exploration
# - fixed number of iterations (1000-5000 should be reasonable)

# general procedure:
# start with root (=board) 
# -> selected node (root at starts) -> expand root (create child using valid action)
# -> simulate randomly until the end -> check who won -> update and backpropagate update (wins, values, and visits) 
# select next node -> ... (do <iterations> times)
# -> select most "promising" child using number of visits 
# (other options can be considered, but win count seems to be the most widely used)

# notes:
# - we want to store the tree so that we can reuse the relevant branches that the game actually followed -> saved state
# - it might be interesting to incorporate the move count into the win_value: 
#   -> are fast (random) losses "worse" than slow (random) losses? (somewhat of a heuristic)



Further notes/ideas:
- implement and test reduced depth for 
    a) performance: how fast can we get
    b) results: how good is agent

- check other "best-child-selections"
- check agent vs. agent mode: 
    - agent 1 seems to win suspiciously often, for both starting and not starting
    - only tested for few runs as it takes quite long
    - no obvious errors
    - one potential error: player 2 makes best move from perspective of player 1 (which in most
      cases will not be a terrible move but what will also not win games)
    - so far I checked the code and can see no indication of such error; check again later
