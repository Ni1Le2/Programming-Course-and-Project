- topic: implement agents for connect 4
    - 2 players, turn-based, perfect informaton
    - phase 1: minmax/MCTS agent - individual (prototype, after ~ 5 weeks, ~May 19th)
    - phase 2: (almost) free choice of more sophisticated agents - groups (project, at the end of semester)
    - pass/fail (prototype: 40, project: 50, final presentation: 10), 50 to pass
    - exam registration until May 16th (?)

- course content: software carpentry/project management
    - version control, test-driven development, documentation, debugging, profiling & optimization, other topics

- about developing coding habits -> takes time
- pay attention to tools, material on moodle page, documentation etc.

- tutorials: mondays 10-14
    - teaching components to discss things of general interest
    - time to work on project, discuss, get help or feedback

----------------------------

- reliable code
- efficient developments and implementation
- share/publish code
- maintain/update improve code -> readable and understandable, documentation
- easy and intuitive understandable
- flexible/adaptable/expandable code
- correctness and tests are critical

good code:
- work, easy to read, testable, efficient, easy to change, simple


convention for scientific code -> see slides

dependency management:
- conda (outdated?)
- Uv (recommendation)
